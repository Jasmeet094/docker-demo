# Weather Application On Docker (flask and React)

In this demo we are ging to create a simple weather application using Docker Compose. There are 2 apps Frontend and Backend. Frontend app is using `react`  while Backend application is using `Flask` framework.

Backend and Front folders contains files and requirements related to their apps.
docker-compose.yaml is used to create these 2 apps at once , running on same network ,  in this way these 2 apps constainer can connect with each other.

There are also 2 different docker files for both apps.

We  can simply run below command to see the workign of the application

`docker-compose up -d`

### Application should be accessible at `http://localhost:8000/api/weather`

## Try and play with this app :)

# Thanks.........!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
